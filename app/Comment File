activity_login.xml is the login screen
activity_main_menu is the main menu. This main menu contains three tabs.
medical_tab.xml = TAB 1
lifestyle_tab.xml = TAB 2
profile_tab.xml = TAB 3
These tabs will contain lists of options the user can choose which will take them to a new screen.

The first step I want to take is to create a plain screen with a button so that we can link each screen together.
From there we can edit the UI and handle the data through the backend work.
