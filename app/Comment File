activity_login.xml is the login screen
activity_main_menu is the main menu. This main menu contains three tabs.
medical_tab.xml = TAB 1
lifestyle_tab.xml = TAB 2
profile_tab.xml = TAB 3
These tabs will contain lists of options the user can choose which will take them to a new screen.

The first step I want to take is to create a plain screen with a button so that we can link each screen together.
From there we can edit the UI and handle the data through the backend work.

I made new directories to organize our Java files.
    - medical
        - activation
        - clinic locator
        - messenger
        - patient chart
        - test results
    - lifestyle
        - exercise log
        - food/water log
        - goal/note log
        - weight log
The log in screen goes to the main menu which is three tabbed activities.
    - Medical
    - Lifestyle
    - Profile
The header is missing, so I will be working on fixing that.
Both of the medical/lifestyle tabs allow the user to click on each item.
To Do:
    Create "Return" buttons for each of the following layouts:
        - activation
        - clinic locator
        - messenger
        - patient chart
        - test results
        - exercise log
        - food/water log
        - goal/note log
        - weight log
You can mimic the activation button the medical tab.
